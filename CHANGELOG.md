### Added
- start import wizard from every screen (`@WithImport` Annotation) (#33)
- start import wizard from from import Configuration screen (#32)
- option to go steps back in import wizard (#71)
- BREAKING: make entity attribute selectable in import wizard (#24)
  This change requires to manually go through the existing import configurations and adjust the "Entity attribute" 
  through the help of the new UI.
  `ImportAttributeMapper.entityAttribute` now only stores direct attribute names (not a full path like `team.code` but rather only `team`)
  `ImportAttributeMapper.associationLookupAttribute` is new and stores the Lookup attribute in case of an association (`code` from the example above)
  `ImportAttributeMapper.dynamicAttribute` is no longer used
  `ImportAttributeMapper.attributeType` is new and stores the type of attribute: direct, reference or dynamic
  The adjustments can also be done manually through the entity inspector by changing the above mentioned attributes accordingly.
   

### Changed
- ignore case for enum import (#77)
- `ImportAttributeMapper.entityAttribute` is no longer mandatory. In case it is not configured correctly, the column will not be imported and a corresponding log message
  will be created. This leads to less user facing errors in the import wizard.
